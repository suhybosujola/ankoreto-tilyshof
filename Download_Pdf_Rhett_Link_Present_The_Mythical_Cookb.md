Overview
From the larger-than-life team behind the internetâ€™s most-watched daily show, Good Mythical Morning, and culinary spinoff, Mythical Kitchen, a one-of-a-kind cookbook with 100 recipes for living a Mythical, and delicious, life. When it comes to foodâ€”the good, the gooder, and the shockingly not un-goodâ€”Mythical Chef Josh, Rhett &amp; Link, and the Mythical Kitcheneers have just about done it all. Theyâ€™ve taste-tested, mythbusted, and dreamed up the most inventive, delicious, and ridiculous foods imaginable, all for your eyeballs to eat on-screen. But, since your mouth does a much better job of eating than your eyeballs, this flavor-packed cookbook is bringing the best of the Mythical extended universe into your kitchen. From breakfast to dessert and everything in between, inside these pages youâ€™ll find fan favorites and new inspirations including: Garlic Bread McMuffins Chicken and Waffles Pot Pie Grilled Cheese Ramen Linkâ€™s Momâ€™s Country Fried Steak Rhettâ€™s Top Secret Baked Beans Animal-Style Mac â€˜nâ€™ Cheese Skittle-Milk French Toast Flaminâ€™ Hot Cheetos Chicken Sandwich Sriracha Fish &amp; Chips Elvis Bread Pudding Pop Tart Lava Cakes Filled with one-of-a-kind recipes, profound life advice, candid photos, and at least one weird story about an angry toaster thatâ€™s come to life, The Mythical Cookbook will help you cook deliciously, eat happily, and live Mythically. And have no fear: while their on-screen creations push food to the limits, the recipes in this book are delicious and doable for real life in real kitchens. Bring extra napkins to the tableâ€”youâ€™ll need them.
