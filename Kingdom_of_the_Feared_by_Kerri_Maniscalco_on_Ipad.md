From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Stalking Jack the Ripper series comes the steamy conclusion to Kingdom of the Wicked trilogy.
 Â 
Two curses.
One prophecy.
A reckoning all have feared.
 Â 
And a love more powerful than fate. All hail the king and queen of Hell.
 Â 
 Emilia is reeling from a shocking discovery about her sister, Vittoria. But before she faces the demons of her past, Emilia yearns to claim her king, the seductive Prince of Wrath, in the flesh. She doesnâ€™t just desire his body; she wants his heart and soulâ€”but thatâ€™s something the enigmatic demon canâ€™t promise her.
 Â 
 When a high-ranking member of House Greed is assassinated, damning evidence somehow points to Vittoria as the murderer. Now, Emilia will do anything to get to the bottom of these accusations against the sister she thought she knew.
 Â 
 Together, Emilia and Wrath play a sin-fueled game of deception to solve the murder and stop the unrest thatâ€™s brewing between witches, demons, shape-shifters, and the most treacherous foes of all: the Feared. Emilia was warned that when it came to the Wicked, nothing was as it seemed. But have the true villains been much closer all along?
 Â 
 #1 New York Times bestselling author Kerri Maniscalco delivers sizzling romance, sexy secrets, and unexpected twists in this unforgettable conclusion to the Kingdom of the Wicked series!
