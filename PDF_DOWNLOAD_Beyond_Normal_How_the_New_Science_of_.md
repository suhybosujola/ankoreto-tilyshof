&amp;quot;A groundbreaking approach to reclaiming health.&amp;quot; â€”David Perlmutter, MD, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Grain Brain and Drop Acid For decades, modern medicine has predominantly focused on restoring health to a conventionally &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; state for our age and medical history. But shouldn&amp;#039;t we aim to go beyond normal? Whether you&amp;#039;re twenty or eighty years old, have experienced a stroke, battle PTSD, or want to excel as an athlete or top executive, recent breakthroughs in molecular biology have granted us the means not just to repair but to enhance our physical and mental capacities. As the visionary director of the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, Dr. Shai Efrati has harnessed these cutting-edge insights to develop a rigorously researched protocol called enhanced medicine. Enhanced medicine answers the fundamental question &amp;quot;What is my biological potential?&amp;quot; with a groundbreaking approach that has yielded remarkable results, including: 
 -Empowering high-performing executives and elite athletes to attain their peak physical and mental states
 
 - Successfully reversing the anticipated age-related cognitive and functional decline
 
 - Restoring movement, vision, and expression in stroke survivors
 
 - Healing the brains of concussion patients, restoring their cognitive, mental, and physical performance
 
 - Transforming the lives of fibromyalgia patients, alleviating symptoms and improving their quality of life
 
 - Significantly reducing symptoms of PTSD in civilians and military veterans
 
 - Enhancing key indicators of Long COVID, restoring cognitive, mental, and physical functions
 Beyond Normal unveils a revolutionary perspective on the possibilities of modern medicine.
