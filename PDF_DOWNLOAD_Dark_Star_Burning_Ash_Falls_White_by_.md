 The epic sequel to the book Song of Silver, Flame Like Night, is a fast-paced, riveting YA fantasy inspired by the mythology and folklore of ancient China.

 The Demon Gods have risen. Skies‚Äô End has fallen to the colonizers. And Lan and Zen have chosen sides.

 But they will not fight together.

 Though Lan inherited the power of the Silver Dragon, she understands the path she must take. She believes the Demon Gods to be the cause of war, conflict, and turmoil, and that the future of the Last Kingdom depends on their being eliminated forever. Worse, she knows that if the Elantians manage to bind one of the legendary beings, their army will be unstoppable and any hopes of Hin rebellion will be crushed. To save her kingdom and her people, Lan will need to find the only mythical weapon capable of destroying the Demon Gods: the Godslayer.

 Zen knows the only way to defeat the Elantians and free the Last Kingdom is to use the power of the Demon Gods. When he bound the Black Tortoise, he paid the ultimate price: to inherit its strength, he will forfeit his body, his mind, and his soul. Yet one Demon God is not enough against the might of the Elantian Empire. In the ruins of the northern Mansorian lands slumbers a magical army of demonic practitioners capable of facing off against the Elantians‚Äîbut Zen must find the Seal to awaken them to fight by his side.

 At the center of both Lan‚Äôs and Zen‚Äôs journeys is the fabled desert city of Shaklahira, a former stronghold of the Imperial Court that vanished without a trace when the Elantians invaded. Its location is a mystery, and both are sure that it holds the answers they need, but the past it hides might be more dangerous than anything they‚Äôve faced yet.

 The battle for the Last Kingdom rages on. But to win the war, Lan will have to face the ultimate choice‚Äîwill she kill the boy she loves to free her people?
