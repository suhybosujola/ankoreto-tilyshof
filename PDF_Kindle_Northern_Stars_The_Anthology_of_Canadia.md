From the earliest days of modern science fiction, Canada has given readers some of the most important authors in the field--and many of the finest stories. World Fantasy Award-winning editor David G. Hartwell has teamed up with Canadian writer and critic Glenn Grant to compile Northern Stars, an anthology of stories by the writers who have built Canada&amp;#039;s rich science fiction tradition. Now in paperback for the first time, Northern Stars is the definitive overview of science fiction&amp;#039;s northern frontier, a valuable addition to any fan&amp;#039;s library.
