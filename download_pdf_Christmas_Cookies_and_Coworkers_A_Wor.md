He&amp;#039;s loved her since the first day they met, but she&amp;#039;s more interested in helping others find their happily ever after. Eve has spent her young adult life playing matchmaker for the guests at Sweet Paradise Resort. Just because she hasn&amp;#039;t found love yet doesn&amp;#039;t mean she&amp;#039;s doomed to live alone, does it? Besides, she has different dreams that come first. One day, she&amp;#039;s going to be the head organizer for the events at the resort, and nothing is going to stop her. Gabriel can&amp;#039;t remember a day when he didn&amp;#039;t have feelings for Eve. She&amp;#039;s always been his bright light in an otherwise dim world. Eve doesn&amp;#039;t know about his feelings, but she will because he&amp;#039;s finally going to do it. He&amp;#039;s going to ask her out. Then everything gets tipped sideways when Eve insists on setting Gabriel up with someone who would be perfect for him. But, there&amp;#039;s a problem. Seeing him with someone does something strange to her heart. Is it possible she&amp;#039;s made the biggest mistake of her life? Can she get up the courage to admit there is no one else she&amp;#039;d rather be with?
