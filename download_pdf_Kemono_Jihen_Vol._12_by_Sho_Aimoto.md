PREPARING TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT...
 
 Inari cuts a terrifying figure as she continues her relentless pursuit of the stones, and Nobimaru seems to be up to something behind the scenes...

Shiki and Akira join in, and the four of them make their way to the mountains of Gunma, where they should find an old friend of Inugami&amp;#039;s.
